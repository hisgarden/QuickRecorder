# QuickRecorder Permission Dialog Fix

## Issue Description
When building and running QuickRecorder in Xcode, the macOS screen recording permission dialog would stay open or keep reappearing, creating a poor user experience.

## Root Cause Analysis
The problem was caused by two main issues:

1. **Immediate Permission Check on Startup**: The app was calling `SCContext.updateAvailableContentSync()` during `applicationWillFinishLaunching`, which immediately triggered the screen recording permission dialog.

2. **Infinite Retry Loop**: When users declined the permission, the code in `SCContext.swift` created an infinite retry loop that kept showing the permission dialog every second:
   ```swift
   case SCStreamError.userDeclined:
       DispatchQueue.global().asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 1) {
           self.updateAvailableContent() {_ in}
       }
   ```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Infinite Retry Loop
Modified `updateAvailableContent(completion:)` in `SCContext.swift` to gracefully handle permission denials:
- Removed the infinite retry loop when permissions are declined
- Added proper error handling that returns `nil` instead of retrying
- Enhanced completion handler to return the content when successful

### 2. Added Proper Permission Checking
Added new async permission checking functions to `SCContext.swift`:
- `checkScreenRecordingPermission()`: Checks permissions without triggering dialogs
- `requestScreenRecordingPermissionIfNeeded()`: Only shows permission dialog when actually needed

### 3. Deferred Permission Requests
Modified `prepRecord()` in `RecordEngine.swift` to:
- Check permissions only when recording is actually attempted (not on startup)
- Handle permission requests asynchronously
- Gracefully handle permission denials without infinite loops

### 4. Improved App Startup
Updated `QuickRecorderApp.swift` to:
- Remove immediate permission checks during app launch
- Defer permission requests until they're actually needed
- Improve overall app startup experience

## Benefits
- ✅ No more persistent permission dialogs on startup
- ✅ Permissions are requested only when needed
- ✅ Graceful handling of permission denials
- ✅ Better user experience during app launch
- ✅ Maintains all recording functionality

## Technical Details
The fix uses proper async/await patterns with `withCheckedContinuation` for permission checking and implements a deferred permission model where screen recording permissions are only requested when the user actually tries to record, not during app startup.

## Testing
- ✅ Build successful with no compilation errors
- ✅ Permission handling code properly integrated
- ✅ Maintains compatibility with existing recording functionality

### 5. **Updated Fix: App Exit After Permission Dialog** (December 2024)
**New Issue Discovered**: After the permission dialog was closed, the app would exit and users couldn't select windows/apps to capture.

**Root Cause**: The `requestPermissions()` function called `NSApp.terminate(self)` which killed the app.

**Final Fix Applied**:
```swift
// Before - App would terminate
private static func requestPermissions() {
    // ... show dialog
    NSApp.terminate(self) // ❌ This killed the app
}

// After - App continues running  
private static func requestPermissions() {
    // ... show dialog with better message
    // ✅ Don't terminate - let user continue after granting permissions
}
```

**Enhanced Permission Flow**:
1. **Better messaging**: Updated dialog text to explain next steps
2. **Graceful continuation**: App stays open after permission dialog
3. **Re-check permissions**: Automatically checks if user granted permission
4. **Helpful feedback**: Shows clear message if permissions still denied
5. **Try again workflow**: Users can retry recording after granting permissions

## Final Result  
✅ **Fixed Permission Dialog Loop** - No more infinite retry when permissions denied
✅ **Deferred Permission Check** - Only requests permissions when actually needed  
✅ **Proper Error Handling** - Graceful handling of permission denials
✅ **Better User Experience** - App doesn't force permission check on startup
✅ **No App Exit** - App continues running after permission dialog
✅ **Clear User Guidance** - Better messages explaining what to do next
✅ **Retry Capability** - Users can grant permissions and immediately try again

The permission dialog now behaves properly:
- Only appears when you try to record (not on app startup)
- Doesn't infinitely retry when declined  
- Doesn't keep the dialog "stuck open"
- **App stays open** after permission dialog is closed
- Users can grant permissions and immediately continue using the app
- Clear guidance on what to do if permissions are needed
