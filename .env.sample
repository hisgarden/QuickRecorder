# 1. Keychain: ./buildRelease.sh --setup-keychain (recommended)
# 2. CLI prompt: Just run 'just notarize' and enter password when prompted
# 3. Environment variable: export APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD before running

# Apple ID Email Address (safe to store here)
APPLE_ID=your-email@example.com

# Apple Team ID (only needed if you have multiple developer teams)
# Find it by running: xcrun notarytool history --apple-id YOUR_EMAIL --password YOUR_PASSWORD
# APPLE_TEAM_ID=ABCD1234EF

# ⚠️  PASSWORD SECURITY NOTES:
# - Use APP-SPECIFIC PASSWORD, NOT your Apple ID password

# - Format: xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx (16 characters)
# - Never commit this file to git
